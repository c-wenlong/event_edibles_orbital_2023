/// Problem ///
///////////////

Telegram group chat which allows students to take free leftover foods at any buffet within NUS. However, we see many missed opportunities because the free food messages are sent impromptu and us students have so many telegram chats to scan through already. Could we make this information more accessible to students?

/// Calender ///
////////////////

Organisers can upload their events onto a shared calendar which students can access through this application. They can then approach the venue to retrieve the food. There will be a survey done at the end to indicate the amt of food left, which we collect to update the status of the buffet. 

////////////////////////
/// Location Tracker ///
////////////////////////

We plan to implement a location tracker so that students can be notified when they are near an event with food. A notification will be sent out when a) the person is near the event location and b) the food collection has already begun.
